## Project Overview

This is my first college project, a simple static Furniture Rental website created as part of my coursework at Indus University. The website is designed to showcase a variety of rental furniture options with a focus on clean design and user-friendly navigation.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Displays an overview of available furniture for rent.
- **Furniture Listings:** Lists various furniture items with details such as descriptions, images, and pricing.
- **Contact Form:** Allows users to make rental inquiries. The form is connected to a PHP script for backend processing.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Handles the styling and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity and dynamic content.
- **PHP:** Manages form submissions and other server-side processing.

3. **Run on a Local Server:**
   - Since the project includes PHP, you need to run it on a local server like XAMPP, WAMP, or use the built-in PHP server.
   - If using the built-in PHP server, navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:8000
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
